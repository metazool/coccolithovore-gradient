# Migrate Colab model to Paperspace

 * Add dependencies from StyleGAN2 and forambulator
 * Add tfrecords for grayscaled 128x128 Mikrotax coccoliths
 * Add the last known good pickled network snapshot from Colab
 * In theory we can now register and [run this model in Gradient-CI](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/tutorials/registering-models-in-gradient)
